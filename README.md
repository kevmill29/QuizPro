Quiz App
This is a simple quiz application built using React. The app displays a start screen with a button to begin the quiz. Once the quiz is started, the questions are displayed one by one. The user can select their answers and move to the next question. At the end of the quiz, the user can see their final score.

Dependencies
The app has the following dependencies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
react-dom: A package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of the app.
react-scripts: A set of scripts and configuration used by Create React App.
File Structure
The codebase is organized as follows:

App.css: CSS styles specific to the App component.
Start.js: Component that displays the start screen of the quiz.
Quiz.js: Component that handles the logic and rendering of the quiz questions.
App.js: The main component that acts as the entry point for the application.
index.js: The entry point for rendering the React app.
How It Works
The App component is the main component of the application. It manages the state of whether to show the quiz or not using the useState hook. The handleClick function toggles the value of showQuiz when the "Start Quiz" button is clicked.

Based on the value of showQuiz, the component conditionally renders either the Start component and the "Start Quiz" button or the Quiz component.

The Start component is responsible for rendering the start screen of the quiz. The Quiz component handles the logic and rendering of the quiz questions.

Customization
You can customize the app by modifying the components or adding new ones based on your requirements. The styles can be adjusted by editing the CSS file (App.css) or by adding additional CSS files.
